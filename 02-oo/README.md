# Intro to Object Orientation

## Key Questions
1. Set the scene (10min)
  * What does OO stand for? Is it a Ruby thing? 
  * What is an `object` in the programming domain? What is an object in ruby? What are some types of objects we've worked with before?
2. Do it ourselves (10min)
  * What is a class? What are some classes we've worked with before?
    * How do I create one?
  * How can I create an instance of a class in Ruby?
  * What's the difference between a class and an instance?
3. Instance methods and instance variables (15min)
  * How can I create instance methods?
  * How can I pass arguments when I instantiate (create) a new instance?
  * What is the difference between a local, global, and instance variable? 
  * Why is it a good thing that variables have scope? 
  * Why shouldn't I use global variables?

## After the break
* How can I define attribute readers and writers using `attr_` macros? (5min)
* How can I create class methods? (10min)
* What is self? (10min)
* How can I call methods on the implicit or explicit `self`? (5min)
  
## Maybe
* How can I use OO with the array compositions (`each`, `map`, `select`, `find`) we discussed yesterday?
* Why do we sometimes talk about calling methods as sending messages? What happens if we send a message that our instance doesn't understand?
